# checkio
A collection of my solved python problems from CheckIO.com.

The problems are divided into folders based upon which "island" / category they were put into. I will specify the problem as well as my solution.

In order to see the problems in order of difficulty (as most categories have varying difficulties within them), sort by time as opposed to alphabetically. I have also included each problem's category of difficulty at the top of each file.

The order of difficulty is as follows:
1. Elementary
2. Simple
3. Moderate
4. Challenging
